-Description: This Model , helps detect parkinson’s disease based on data collected 
from subjects who are confirmed to have parkinson’s disease and parkinson’s disease. 
This model scored an accuracy score of 87% when testing it.

Event Management System  — University project
I created a Database software using Mysql,  where I created a a mini-world , 
for organizers to help them organize all types of events, and all their technicalities.
This project was a requirement for the database course i took in university, and i scored 95/100.

Safety Hazard Notifier Systems — University project
This is a project for a Arduino  3 credit course i took in university,
which i used Arduino Uno. In this project Used temperature and gas sensors
to alert resident of a house about a fire or of a potential carbon monoxide poisoning.
In this project i used C++ for coding, and tinkercad as a simulation for the sensors.
