Event Management System  — University project
I created a Database software using Mysql,  where I created a mini-world, 
for organizers to help them organize all types of events and all their technicalities.
This project was a requirement for the database course I took in university, and I scored 95/100.

Safety Hazard Notifier Systems — University project
This is a project for an Arduino  3 credit course I took in university,
in which I used Arduino Uno. This project Used temperature and gas sensors
to alert residents of a house about a fire or of potential carbon monoxide poisoning.
In this project, I used C++ for coding, and Tinkercad as a simulation for the sensors.
